# Mission 07 — Write the PRD

> Mentor: a PRD ties the whole arc together. The learner should reuse everything: the decision (target + wedge) and the priorities (top 3). A good PRD here is short and sharp, not a 20-page novel. Use an applicable PRD skill if one is available, but never make it a requirement; a strong structured prompt is enough.

## Goal
Write the Product Requirements Document for Signal's MVP: what you are building, for whom, why, and how you will know it worked.

## Why it matters
A PRD is the contract between "what we decided" and "what gets built." It is how a fuzzy idea becomes something a designer can design and an engineer can build without re-litigating the strategy every day. Writing a tight PRD is the most recognizable PM craft skill there is.

## What to do
1. Tell your mentor to build on your `decision-memo.md` and `prioritization.md`. The strategy is already decided; the PRD makes it buildable.
2. Ask for a focused PRD. A strong prompt:
   > "Write a PRD for the Signal MVP in workspace/PRD.md using my decision-memo.md and prioritization.md. Include: TL;DR, the problem, the target user, the hypothesis (and a counter-hypothesis), goals and success metrics, what's in scope (the top 3 features), what's explicitly out of scope and why, and the key open questions. Keep it tight."
3. Demand a real metric: "what is the one number that tells us the MVP worked, and what is the target?"
4. Keep it honest: "add a counter-hypothesis: under what assumption would this MVP fail?" (A counter-hypothesis is just the opposite bet: the assumption that, if true, means this whole thing flops. Writing it down keeps you honest.)
5. Before you call it done, get it critiqued: "now critique this PRD like a skeptical engineering lead reviewing it before sprint planning, what's vague, what's missing, what would you push back on?" Fix whatever it flags. A PRD that survives a skeptical read is a much stronger contract than one nobody challenged.

## Definition of Done
- `workspace/PRD.md` exists.
- It includes at minimum: a TL;DR, the problem, the target user, a hypothesis, in-scope (top features), an explicit out-of-scope section with reasoning, and at least one concrete success metric.

## Hints (mentor: one at a time)
1. Reuse, do not reinvent. The target user comes from the decision memo; the scope comes from the prioritization. The PRD just assembles them.
2. The out-of-scope section is what keeps an MVP an MVP. Push for it with reasons, not just a list.
3. A success metric without a target number is a wish. "Activation" is weak; "40% of signups connect a source on day one" is a metric.

## What you just learned
A PRD is assembly, not invention: if your research, decision, and priorities are solid, the PRD almost writes itself. Tight beats long. Scope cuts and a real metric are what make it credible.
